        <h3>The Mysterious Koala - A Researcher's Findings</h3>
        <p>
          Koalas are fucking horrible animals. They have one of the smallest
          brain to body ratios of any mammal, additionally - their brains are
          smooth. A brain is folded to increase the surface area for neurons. If
          you present a koala with leaves plucked from a branch, laid on a flat
          surface, the koala will not recognise it as food. They are too thick
          to adapt their feeding behaviour to cope with change. In a room full
          of potential food, they can literally starve to death. This is not the
          token of an animal that is winning at life. Speaking of stupidity and
          food, one of the likely reasons for their primitive brains is the fact
          that additionally to being poisonous, eucalyptus leaves (the only
          thing they eat) have almost no nutritional value. They can't afford
          the extra energy to think, they sleep more than 80% of their fucking
          lives. When they are awake all they do is eat, shit and occasionally
          scream like fucking satan.
