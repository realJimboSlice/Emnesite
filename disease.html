        <h3>Infected, disgusting and simply stupid</h3>
        <p>
          Koalas are riddled with chlamydia. In some areas the infection rate is
          80% or higher. This statistic isn't helped by the fact that one of the
          few other activities koalas will spend their precious energy on is
          rape. Despite being seasonal breeders, males seem to either not know
          or care, and will simply overpower a female regardless of whether she
          is ovulating. If she fights back, he may drag them both out of the
          tree, which brings us full circle back to the brain: Koalas have a
          higher than average quantity of cerebrospinal fluid in their brains.
          This is to protect their brains from injury... should they fall from a
          tree. An animal so thick it has its own little built in special ed
          helmet. I fucking hate them.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In conclusion: Koalas are stupid, leaky, disease-ridden sex offenders.
          But, hey. They look cute. If you ignore the terrifying snake eyes and
          terrifying feet.
