        <h3>A plant not meant to be eaten</h3>
        <p>
          Because eucalyptus leaves hold such little nutritional value, koalas
          have to ferment the leaves in their guts for days on end. Unlike their
          brains, they have the largest hind gut to body ratio of any mammal.
          Many herbivorous mammals have adaptations to cope with harsh plant
          life taking its toll on their teeth, rodents for instance have teeth
          that never stop growing, some animals only have teeth on their lower
          jaw, grinding plant matter on bony plates in the tops of their mouths,
          others have enlarged molars that distribute the wear and break down
          plant matter more efficiently... Koalas are no exception, when their
          teeth erode down to nothing, they resolve the situation by starving to
          death, because they're fucking terrible animals.
        </p>
        <p>
          Being mammals, koalas raise their joeys on milk - admittedly, one of
          the lowest milk yields to body ratio. When the young joey needs to
          transition from rich, nourishing substances like milk, to eucalyptus -
          a plant that seems to be making it abundantly clear that it doesn't
          want to be eaten - it finds it does not have the necessary gut flora
          to digest the leaves. To remedy this, the young joey begins nuzzling
          its mother's anus until she leaks a little diarrhoea - actually fecal
          pap, slightly less digested - which he then proceeds to slurp on. This
          partially digested plant matter gives him just what he needs to start
          developing his digestive system. Of course, he may not even have
          needed to bother nuzzling his mother. She may have been suffering from
          incontinence. Why?
